# Hands-On: Django

Example website build using Django.

## Contents

This repository contains a very basic Django project, containing:
1. A custom App (`"playground"`), containing:
   1. Very rudimentary **routing** (`playground/urls.py`) with custom `URLconf` and namespace
   2. Very rudimentary, but extensible **views** (`playground/views.py`)
2. Custom Styling, furthermore:
   1. **SCSS Support**
   2. A small SCSS **theming utility** for coloring the site using a palette
   3. A small SCSS **debugging utility** for highlighting elements inside the DOM
